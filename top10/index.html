		<h2>4) Good Books, but not the Kind from School</h2>
			<p>Books are really good to escape the drudgeries of school and life in general, as long they are not school books or books about asparagus</p>

		<h3><img src="images/dog.jpg" alt="A little puppy barking"></h3>
		<h2>6) Dogs that are not chihuahuas or the kind that grow hair that need to be shaved</h2>
			<p>Dogs are fun and cute, as long as they don't bite of your nose or shake like a Chihuahua does because that is just weird. <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/">Humane Society</a></p>
		<h3><img src="images/icecream.jpg" alt="A Bowl of Beautiful Ice Cream"></h3>
		<h2>7) Deliciously Delectable Ice Cream</h2>

		<h3><img src="images/keanureeves.jpg" alt="Keanu Reeves Winking Face"></h3>
		<h2>8) Keanu Reeves</h2>
			<p>This one is a long story, if you want to really know the reason this is on there, it's because I wrote an essay about books for Mrs. Koon's College Camp, but then I changed every time it says "books" to "Keanu Reeves." It made Mrs. Koon cry from laughing so hard. Here's an excerpt from that essay:</p>
			<p>One of the few things in my life that captivate me is Keanu Reeves, who I will watch insatiably for nearly the entire day. Keanu Reeves holds fear, desire, adventure, and escape.  He offers a vast array of knowledge.  Keanu Reeves contain secrets that must be dug up from the dusty tomes found deep in Hollywood.  </p>
			<p>Keanu Reeves owns a Motorcycle company called <a href="https://www.archmotorcycle.com/">Arch Motorcycles</a></p>

		<h2>Drawing</h2>

You can look at art at the <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/">Guggenheim Museum.</a> Guggenheim is a fun word to say, kind of like indubitably.</p>
