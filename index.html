				<h2>Brendan's Biography</h2>
				<p>Hi, I am Brendan Cummings.  I am currently in 12th grade at a small high school in Greenville, SC.  I enjoy many things in life.  I have 4 pets, a dog, 2 cats, and a squeaky guinea pig.  I used to have a hermit crab, but it died :'(.  I like to live life to its fullest and never waste time getting organized.  </p>
